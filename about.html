            <h2>My story</h2>
            <p>My name is Katica Pranjic, but you can call me Kaya! :)</p>
            <p>
              I am living and working in Munich for the last 6 years, originally
              coming from beautiful Croatia. After finishing my graphic design
              high school in Croatia, I was torn between my two biggest passions
              painting and dancing. That lead me on a journey of self-discovery
              and exploration. I decided to move to Germany at 22, which is a
              journey that I am currently still on. After having some
              unfulfilling jobs and trying to create my own business on the side
              which didn't work, I really didn't know what to do. Then I found
              UX and UI, and it clicked with me big time. The industry is
              progressive and offers a lot of opportunities, it is analytical
              and creative, and it helps people - basically everything I ever
              wanted. It fits me perfectly, and I really enjoy learning and
              working as a designer. I am very motivated and driven to create a
              professional design career and I believe I have found what I was
              looking for. When I am not designing you can find me dancing,
              painting or in nature listening to podcasts and audiobooks from
              great minds.
